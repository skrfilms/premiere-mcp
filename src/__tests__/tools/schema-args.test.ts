/**
 * The argument seeder must produce arguments the tools accept.
 *
 * Every guard in this suite drives tools through this helper, so when it produces
 * a value a schema rejects, that tool emits nothing and drops out of *all* of them
 * silently. Nothing goes red; coverage just quietly shrinks. That has now happened
 * three times, each from reading a zod internal that is wrong in this build:
 *
 *   _def.typeName  undefined, so every field became the string "x"
 *   _def.values    undefined for enums, so all 20 enum fields got "start"
 *   _def.type      the string "array", not the element schema
 *
 * Guarding the accessors individually would only catch the ones I thought to
 * check. This asserts the property that actually matters and is independent of how
 * the seeder is written: whatever it produces, the schema takes it.
